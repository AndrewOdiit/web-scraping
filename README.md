SCRAPING CHALLENGES

TASK1

Consists of a python based implementation for the xpaths used in google sheets,
however it reads from case.html instead of the remote host (leboncoin.fr).

TASK2

Consists of a python based implementation of the regular expressions hosted on regex101.com.
It reads from the case.json file.

TASK 3

Task 3 consists of a python solution only that scrapes data
from the remote host and writes it to a csv file.

NB: The links to the google sheets and regex101.com solutions have been shared via
google drive
